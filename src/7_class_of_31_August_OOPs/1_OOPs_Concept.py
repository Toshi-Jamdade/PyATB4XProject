#OOPs
#Object Oriented Programming
# Something related to objects & classes
# OOPs divide the program into classes & objects
# Emphasis is on data
# E.g: Python, Java
# Productivity is high


#Procedural Programming Language
#Everything that you create a program, you can divide them into functions.
# def sum(), sum(3,4)
# data members - data variables & functions - methods - PPL -most things are focused on functions only
# It is not that close to real world
# emphasis is on doing the things
# E.g; C
# Productivity is low

#OOPs:

# Object Oriented programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes & objects.


# Class - Blueprint - A class is a blueprint that can have some properties & functions (called methods)
# Class is a user defined data type which defines its properties & methods
# Attributes OR Properties OR data variables OR Data members
# Behaviours OR Methods(functions) OR Member functions

# Object - Instance of class, real world entity from the class
# Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item.
# All data members & member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects.

#OOPs Concept:
# Everything has 2 things:
# 1. Attributes & 2. Behaviour

#Example:
#GOD wants to create people
#Person Blueprint(Class)
    #Attribute:
        # 1. names
        # 2. gender
        # 3. age
        # 4. phone numbers
        # 5. address
        # 6. height
        # 7. weight
    #Behaviour:
        # 1. walk()
        # 2. sleep()
        # 3. eat()
        # 4. talk()
        # 5. see()

# Based on above blueprint, real world entity = Karthik
    #Attribute:
        # 1. name = Karthik
        # 2. gender = Male
        # 3. age = 31
        # 4. phone number = 9876543210
        # 5. address = KA
        # 6. height = 5.10
        # 7. weight = 70 KG
    # Behaviour:
        # 1. walk() = slow
        # 2. sleep() = late
        # 3. eat() = junk food
        # 4. talk() = too much
        # 5. see() = lot of tv

#Blueprint = Dog:
    #Attributes:
        #1. Breed
        #2. Size
        #3. Age
        #4. Color
    #Behaviour:
        #1. eat()
        #2. sleep()
        #3. sit()
        #4. run()
